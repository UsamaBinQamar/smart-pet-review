                As pet owners ourselves, we would never recommend something that could put your pet
                in danger or harm. We do recommend, however, for any medical issues or health related
                topics, that you check with a veterinarian or qualified health professional if you
                have any doubts about your pet&apos;s specific condition or circumstances.
